When Customer or a third party sends Supported Digital Assets to a Dakota Wallet address, the person initiating the Transaction is solely responsible for executing the Transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network fees in order for the Transaction to be successful. Dakota has no obligation to assist in the remediation of such Transactions. When Customer sends cryptocurrency from a Dakota Wallet to another digital asset wallet, such transfers are executed on chain by Customer and not under the control of Dakota. Customer should verify all Transaction information prior to submission. Dakota shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event Customer enters an incorrect blockchain destination address. Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant cryptocurrency network, although they  may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the Transaction is processed by network operators.

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Party granting the waiver. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws that would lead to the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
